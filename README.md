## Introduction

Vue.js is a progressive framework for JavaScript, and used to build web interfaces and SPA.

Pros:

- Two-way data binding
  - Just like Angular
- Gentle learning curve
  - Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Plugin support from popular code editors
- Concise docummentation
  - Well structured, can learn and master from their own website
- Solid tooling ecosystem
  - Route management (Vue-Router)
  - State management (Vuex)
  - Browser debugging tools
- Single-file components & readability
  - Component reusability
    - Encapsulated components are basically chunks of code that can be reused as templates for similar system elements.
  - Code readability
    - As all the components are stored in separate files (and each component is just a single file), the code is easier to read and understand, which makes it easier to maintain and fix.

Cons:

- Plugins not as vast as competitors

Best Fit:

- Prototypes
- Fast-paced small projects

"Progressive" means its implemented as additional markup to html. If the model is updated the browsers HTML is updated, that is it reacts to model updates.
